# Utility Tools Catalogue

The objective of the catalogue is to map the different utility tools that can be used by law enforcement. 

The catalogue is built using Python + Streamlit.

The current version runs in a local server and reads from an Excel file. 

The next step is to run it in AWS and connnect it to a DB.
